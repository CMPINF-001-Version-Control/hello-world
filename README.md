# Jupyter Python Script to Reverse a User's Name

This Jupyter Python script takes input from the user in the form of their first and last name and then prints their full name and their name in reverse order.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you should have Python 3 and Jupyter installed on your computer.

## Input

The script takes two inputs from the user:

1. First name
2. Last name

## Output

The script prints the following two messages on the screen:

1. Your full name is: [first name] [last name]
2. Your name in reverse is: [reversed name]

For example, if the user enters "John" as their first name and "Doe" as their last name, the output will be:

```
Your full name is: John Doe
Your name in reverse is: eoD nhoJ
```

## Note

- The script uses Python's string slicing feature (`[::-1]`) to reverse the user's name.
